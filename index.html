            <h3>Evening function</h3>
            
            <p>The evening function will be held at Hobbiton!  You'll be transported to The Shire, given a guided tour, a complimentary beverage and food.

Buses will pick you up from 5.15pm to take you to Hobbiton.</p>

            <p><strong>By air</strong></p>

            <p>General aviation - we welcome aircraft to fly in to Matamata but on Saturday 16th the airfield will be closed to arrivals after 0930 for our Reunion aviation event. <a href="http://aip.net.nz/pdf/supplements/aip_supp_7jan16.pdf">AIP Supp 12/16 refers</a>.</p>

            <p>Visiting aircraft should plan to arrive between 0700 and 0900 due to airspace and parking restrictions. In general earlier arrivals will be allocated better parking, latecomers may be parked at various remote corners of the airfield. Arrivals after 0930 will not be possible. Fuel is available, but there may be some congestion at the pump.</p>

            <p>Clearly weather will affect your decision on the day, but if you intend to fly in to NZMA on Saturday 16th please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PJOeuPMipOs7XXw9fgQz7z28CCAF3SrFI6MT-8pdrfQ/viewform">register your intention here</a>. For our planning, we would rather you registered now and cancelled than leave it to the last minute to register.</p>

            <p>Air New Zealand - the closest serviced airports to Matamata are Hamilton and Tauranga.</p>

            <div class="page-header" id="accommodation">
              <h2>Accommodation</h2>
            </div>

            <p>As the 50th school will be taking place at the same time as the 50th celebrations we are unable to offer accommodation at the airfield. There is limited accommodation available in the area, and to make it easy please secure your bed in either Matamata or Cambridge, Hamilton will be our third option (this is to make Hobbiton logistics easier).</p>

            <p><strong>Matamata:</strong> <a href="http://www.matamatanz.co.nz/Places-to-Stay" target="_blank">Please look here for accommodation available in Matamata</a>. The Matamata Central Motel and Tower Road Motel are offering holds or special rates if you tell them you're staying for The Walsh.</p>
            <p><strong>Cambridge:</strong> <a href="http://www.cambridge.co.nz/accommodation/find-accommodation" target="_blank">Check out iSite for accommodation providers</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Hamilton:</strong> Please only book your accommodation in Hamilton if there is nothing left in Matamata or Cambridge.  We've got special rates at the IBIS (quote number 339701) and Novotel (33700).</p>

            <div class="page-header" id="faq">
              <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h4><strong>I have limited mobility (elderly, walking stick, wheelchair), is there much walking during the Hobbiton tour?</strong></h4>
            <p>The tour takes approximately 45 minutes, of which you'll need to be standing and walking on sometimes uneven ground. There's also a small hill to walk over. If you think you're not able to do this, Hobbiton offer the tour from a golf cart. Just let us know if that's more like you.</p>

            <br>
            <h4><strong>I ordered a commemoration booklet, how do I pick it up?</strong></h4>
            <p>The booklet is only available by pick up on January 16 at Matamata airfield. There'll be a signposted place to grab yours.</p>

            <br>
            <h4><strong>I ordered a t-shirt, when does that come?</strong></h4>
            <p>Konstruct are taking care of all that for us. You have until mid November to order, and it will be with you before Christmas. There will be a small number available for purchase on January 16.</p>

            <br>
            <h4><strong>Do you want my photos or memorabilia from past Walshes?</strong></h4>
            <p>YES! We'd love to see it ASAP, please do send it to us!</p>

            <br>
            <h4><strong>Can I volunteer on the day?</strong></h4>
            <p>That would be great! We're going to need help marshalling cars in and out, taking registrations, distributing booklets and selling t-shirts to name a few tasks.  Please get in touch with us.</p>

            <br>
            <h4><strong>I'm going to be an ab-initio student at the 50th Walsh, am I able to attend the reunion celebrations?</strong></h4>
            <p>Unfortunately, the reunion celebrations are not available for ab-initio students.  Focus on the flying and the wonderful things that The Walsh will give you!</p>

            <br>
            <h4><strong>I'm going to be a returned student or student staff at the 50th Walsh, am I able to attend the reunion celebrations?</strong></h4>
            <p>Yes! The celebrations are being run as a separate event to the school, and as such you'll need to buy a ticket to Hobbiton to attend, and you can head along to the day function for free. Please make sure that your Flight and duties are covered while you're connecting with your past Walsh mates!</p>

            <br>
            <h4><strong>I'm hoping to be an instructor at the 50th Walsh, but I'm not sure if I will be on the team/my leave hasn't been approved yet. What should I do?</strong></h4>
            <p>We suggest that you buy a ticket to Hobbiton as soon as you know what your situation is. There are 50 tickets set aside for school staff which will be made available later in the year.  Staff aren't required to purchase tickets to the day event unless you really want to.</p>

            <br>
            <h4><strong>Can I bring my kids?</strong></h4>
            <p>Children are more than welcome at the day time reunion at the airfield.  If they are under 14 years of age there is no charge, however if they're 14 and over an adult ticket must be purchased. We don't have any family pass options.</p>
            <p>Please remember that there are plenty of hazards on the airfield.  The organisers are not responsible for your children, so please keep an eye on them at all times. Hobbiton is for adults only, thanks.</p>
            
            <br>
            <h4><strong>I've purchased my ticket but haven't received a physical ticket yet.  What do I do?</strong></h4>
            <p>It's completely normal for you not to have received a physical ticket, as we're doing this all electronically.</p>
            <p>When you arrive at the airfield, proceed to registration and give your name.  That's it.
            Same goes for the Hobbiton registration procedure, except it'll involve buses and magic.</p>

            <h4><strong>Pan-pan, pan-pan, pan-pan.  Something's come up and I need to get hold of the organisers.</strong></h4>
            <p>We're available using the form above, or you can email us on the50thwalsh@gmail.com, or if it's super urgent give Bronnie a call on 0276201234.</p>
