            <h3>Evening function</h3>
            
            <p>The evening function will be held at Hobbiton!  You'll be transported to The Shire, given a guided tour, a complimentary beverage and food. Your ticket includes transport as it is not possible to drive to the venue. To help us with transport logistics, later in the year we will ask you where you're staying.</p>

              <h2>Accommodation</h2>
            </div>
            
            <p>As the 50th school will be taking place at the same time as the 50th celebrations we are unable to offer accommodation at the airfield. There is limited accommodation available in the area, and to make it easy please secure your bed in either Matamata or Cambridge, Hamilton will be our third option (this is to make Hobbiton logistics easier).</p>
            
            <p><strong>Matamata:</strong> <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/6fqzvodiiz3yens/Matamata%20Accommodation%202014.pdf?dl=0">Please look here for accommodation available in Matamata</a>. The Matamata Central Motel and Tower Road Motel are offering holds or special rates if you tell them you're staying for The Walsh.</p>
            <p><strong>Cambridge:</strong> <a href="http://www.cambridge.co.nz/accommodation/find-accommodation">Check out iSite for accommodation providers</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Hamilton:</strong> Please only book your accommodation in Hamilton if there is nothing left in Matamata or Cambridge.  We've got special rates at the IBIS (quote number 339701) and Novotel (33700).</p>

            <div class="page-header" id="faq">
              <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            </div>
            <br>
            <h4><strong>I have limited mobility (elderly, walking stick, wheelchair), is there much walking during the Hobbiton tour?</strong></h4>
            <p>The tour takes approximately 45 minutes, of which you'll need to be standing and walking on sometimes uneven ground. There's also a small hill to walk over. If you think you're not able to do this, Hobbiton offer the tour from a golf cart. Just let us know if that's more like you.</p>
            
            <br>
            <h4><strong>I ordered a commemoration booklet, how do I pick it up?</strong></h4>
            <p>The booklet is only available by pick up on January 16 at Matamata airfield. There'll be a signposted place to grab yours.</p>

            <br>
            <h4><strong>I ordered a t-shirt, when does that come?</strong></h4>
            <p>Konstruct are taking care of all that for us. You have until mid November to order, and it will be with you before Christmas. There will be a small number available for purchase on January 16.</p>

            <br>
            <h4><strong>Do you want my photos or memorabilia from past Walshes?</strong></h4>
            <p>YES! We'd love to see it ASAP, please do send it to us!</p>

            <br>
            <h4><strong>Can I volunteer on the day?</strong></h4>
            <p>That would be great! We're going to need help marshalling cars in and out, taking registrations, distributing booklets and selling t-shirts to name a few tasks.  Please get in touch with us.</p>

            <br>
            <h4><strong>I'm going to be an ab-initio student at the 50th Walsh, am I able to attend the reunion celebrations?</strong></h4>
            <p>Unfortunately, the reunion celebrations are not available for ab-initio students.  Focus on the flying and the wonderful things that The Walsh will give you!</p>

            <br>
            <h4><strong>I'm going to be a returned student or student staff at the 50th Walsh, am I able to attend the reunion celebrations?</strong></h4>
            <p>Yes! The celebrations are being run as a separate event to the school, and as such you'll need to buy tickets to attend.  Please also make sure that your Flight and duties are covered while you're connecting with your past Walsh mates!</p>
